Overall, this is a very good and readable solution. You will have to fix the following issues, however:

[x] Rewrite "rulesApply" in point-free style. The parameter "p" is quite
   straightforward to remove using function composition, "pps" is a bit
   trickier.

[x] Change "rulesCompile" to only make the patterns lowercase and not the
   replies.

[x] Remove the "r" parameter of "reductionsApply" to make it point-free.

[x] Rewrite "transformationsApply" in point-free style. (Hint: You may find the
    fold functions in the standard prelude useful.)

Some of the above is arguably a matter of taste. However, in this course we
want you to (at least initially) stick to a particular programming style, in
which explicit recursion, explicit function arguments and branching is avoided
when possible.
